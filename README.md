This is a GearBlocks mod that aims to add combustion parts into the game. Piston parts simulate the thrust of an actual piston by applying downward thrust based on timing and the angle of the crank shaft.

## How to install
**Please refer to the GearLib documentation on how to setup BepInEx for your GearBlocks for modding.**
